"ARCADIAN DREAMS"
by George Hu, Seong Ryoo, and Steven Yao (Northview High School, Georgia Chapter)

-- For judges:

Included in the folder are three code blocks which are currently in the game. 

The game uses GML (GameMaker Language) code, but these three scripts have been pasted to .txt format for easy reading!

(for better understanding, note that GML comments begin with "//" and end at the end of a line, but can begin at any point in a line of code) //for example, this would be a GML comment


-- Playing instructions:

To play, simply double click the executable file "Arcadian Dreams" - all you need is a keyboard.

Enjoy!
