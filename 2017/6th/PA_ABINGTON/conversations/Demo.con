Welcome to the demo of Elementarium, a Legend of Zelda 3 inspired clone. Press SPACE to continue conversations, or skip dialogue.
In this demo you will have to face the slime king in the old church. Robed wizards await inside.
Before you can enter, you need to find a bow.
During the demo, you will have unlimited arrows so feel free to use them as you wish.
Because some people can get lost easily, I will tell you in detail how to get to the church.
When you go into the slime territory, north of your yard, you can find a power glove.
When you get the glove come back and you can get the chest that is in the northwest corner of your yard.
You will then get the bow, which is essential to killing King Squish quickly.
With the glove, you will also be able to get to the church by picking up the rocks blocking your path.
A timer will start when this conversation ends that will count how long your demo run has taken.
Your highscore will reflect your time and how many rupees you can collect. Get going.
