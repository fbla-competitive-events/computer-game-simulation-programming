Wondering what seperates these two folders?

"All Source Files From Unity" is a massive folder with over 30 scripts as well as all
 art resources. That folder can be ran from the Unity development platform if you'd like

"Main Code Files" Contains a more manegable selection of code for viewing. If you just
want to look at some of the main programming behind the game, then this is the folder 
for you.
