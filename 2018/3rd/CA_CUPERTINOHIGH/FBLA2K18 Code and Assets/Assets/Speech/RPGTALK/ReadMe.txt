-Now is possible to place sprites inside the text, occupying space as if it were a character in the text;
-You can change the speed of the text while the talk is running;
-Timeline ready;
-Localization inside RPGTalk or any UI Text;
-Easier to change Target Follow during the talk;
-RPGTalk Area to change the text or interact with a character without any code;
