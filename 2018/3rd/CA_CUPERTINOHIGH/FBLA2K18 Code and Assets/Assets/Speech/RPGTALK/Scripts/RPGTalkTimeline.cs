	//The Timeline function into the new Unity is awesome. Really cool.
	//But sadly, it still a little raw, there are still room for improvement
	//The way the "Pause" works on the timeline can create unexpected behaviour in many scripts
	//Like RPGTalk, or even Cinemachine. So the class RPGTalkTimeline makes a new way of Pausing
	//The timeline, forcing it back to one position in time.
	//That solution is provisory and should be changed when the Timeline component improves.
