INTRODUCTION
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
FBLA 2K18 encapsulates and teaches what FBLA is through a fun and interactive game where the players have complete freedom of choice only limited by the content in the world.  When a player first plays this game, they are placed into a city-like environment with a quick and straightforward tutorial. We introduced a way to hook the player using ‘Stats’ that players can earn.  These ‘Stats’ unlock new and hidden secrets in the game. The advancement system is realistic the minigames being general activities part our FBLA chapter, and it allows the players to continuously play the game by giving them a goal to max their stats. We took some creative liberties with the minigames as it being too realistic would being slow and boring, but the players can still learn what FBLA is about from the player’s interaction with the world. 
The user interface and instructions are identified when the gameplay starts in order to minimize player confusion.

Basically, the player has freedom over their choices. Our game incorporates both elements. The player has complete freedom of choice in this world only limited by the content in the game. Whether it be only participating in volunteering events or trying to complete all the tasks in the game.

SOFTWARE USED
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Visual Studio was our integrated development environment used for game mechanics for all actions in game. Unity was used as the backbone of the development of our game. We used it to create the map, the player, and game objects such as the interactive mission board for the player. All objects are from free assets downloaded from the Unity Asset Store.

TEMPLATES USED
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
We imported building models off of the Unity Asset Store and implemented them in our game to create the environment. The gameplay with minigames and the core game mechanics were designed by us.
