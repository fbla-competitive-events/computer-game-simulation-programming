# FBLA: The Game

This game is about what goes on in an average year of an FBLA member. It features minigames that
range from cleaning up trash on the side of a road to boxing soup cans as a fundraising
project. In this game, the player is in complete control of when they want to play a certain
minigame and how many times they want to play it. The game features a difficulty setting and
a multiplayer co-op minigame.
